Product Requirements Document: Advanced Threat Analysis Platform (Project "GuardianShield")
1. Introduction

Project GuardianShield aims to develop a state-of-the-art cloud-based malware analysis platform. It will provide comprehensive threat intelligence by extending beyond the capabilities of existing solutions like Malcore.io. A key differentiator will be the integration of advanced binary analysis alongside static, dynamic, and behavioral analysis of files, URLs, and network traffic. This platform will empower cybersecurity professionals to rapidly understand, detect, and respond to sophisticated cyber threats.
2. Vision

To be the leading platform for automated, in-depth malware analysis, providing actionable intelligence that significantly reduces the time to detect and mitigate cyber threats. We will achieve this by offering a multi-faceted analysis engine that includes deep binary inspection, making complex threats transparent.
3. Goals and Objectives

    Develop a comprehensive analysis engine: Capable of static, dynamic, behavioral, and deep binary analysis.
    Enhance existing analysis techniques: Improve upon the speed, accuracy, and depth of analysis currently offered by platforms like Malcore.io.
    Introduce robust binary analysis: Allow users to upload executable files (e.g., .exe, .dll, .elf, .apk, .macho) for in-depth reverse engineering insights, including disassembly, control flow graphs, string extraction, and vulnerability identification.
    User-Friendly Interface: Provide an intuitive dashboard for submitting samples, viewing reports, and managing analyses.
    Actionable Reporting: Generate clear, concise, and detailed reports with threat scores, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and tactical intelligence.
    Scalability and Performance: Build a platform that can handle a high volume of submissions and deliver results quickly.
    API Integration: Offer a robust API for integration with other security tools and workflows (SOAR, SIEM, TIPs).

4. Target Audience

    Security Operations Center (SOC) Analysts: For daily alert triage and incident investigation.
    Incident Responders: For deep-diving into malware samples during or after an incident.
    Malware Researchers: For academic or professional research into malware TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).
    Threat Intelligence Analysts: For gathering IOCs and understanding the threat landscape.
    Forensic Investigators: For analyzing suspicious executables found on compromised systems.

5. Key Features
5.1. Core Analysis Capabilities (Inspired by Malcore.io & Enhanced)

    File Analysis (Static & Dynamic):
        Static Analysis: Metadata extraction, string analysis, hash computation, packer detection, antivirus scan aggregation, manifest file analysis (for mobile apps).
        Dynamic Analysis (Sandboxing): Execution in isolated environments (Windows, Linux, Android, macOS) to observe behavior, including file system changes, registry modifications, network communication, process activity, and API calls.
        Memory Forensics: Analysis of memory dumps from sandboxed execution.
    URL Analysis:
        Reputation checks, screenshotting, HTML/JavaScript static analysis, redirection tracing, phishing detection, dynamic analysis of fetched content.
    Network Traffic Analysis:
        PCAP analysis (if provided or captured during dynamic analysis), protocol identification, malicious traffic pattern detection, C2 communication identification.
    Threat Scoring & Classification:
        AI/ML-powered scoring system to determine the maliciousness level.
        Classification by malware family (e.g., ransomware, trojan, spyware) where possible.
    IOC Extraction:
        Automatic identification and extraction of IPs, domains, URLs, file hashes, registry keys, mutexes, etc.

5.2. Advanced Binary Analysis (New Core Feature) ‚öôÔ∏è

    Supported File Types: PE (Windows executables/DLLs), ELF (Linux executables/libraries), Mach-O (macOS executables/libraries), APK (Android applications), DEX (Dalvik executables).
    Disassembly & Decompilation (where feasible):
        Generate assembly code from binaries.
        Attempt high-level code reconstruction (e.g., C-like pseudocode) for supported architectures.
    Control Flow Graph (CFG) Generation: Visualize the execution paths within the binary.
    String Analysis: Advanced string extraction (ASCII, Unicode) and identification of obfuscated strings.
    Import/Export Table Analysis: Identify used libraries and functions.
    Resource Analysis: Examine embedded resources within binaries.
    Vulnerability Detection (Basic): Identify known vulnerable functions or code patterns (e.g., buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities).
    Anti-Debugging/Anti-VM Detection: Identify techniques used by malware to evade analysis.
    Unpacking & Deobfuscation:
        Automated or semi-automated unpacking of common packers.
        Basic deobfuscation techniques for common obfuscation methods.
    Code Similarity Analysis: Compare binary code against known malware families or libraries.
    YARA Rule Integration: Allow users to run custom YARA rules against binaries and memory.

5.3. Platform Features

    Interactive Dashboard: Centralized view of submissions, ongoing analyses, and historical reports.
    Detailed Reporting: Comprehensive reports with summaries, visual aids (graphs, charts), extracted IOCs, behavioral logs, and binary analysis insights. Reports available in multiple formats (HTML, PDF, JSON, STIX/TAXII).
    API Access: RESTful API for submitting samples, retrieving results, and managing account settings.
    User Management & Workspace: Support for multiple users, roles, and team collaboration.
    Search & Correlation: Ability to search across all submitted analyses and correlate findings.
    Integration with Threat Intelligence Feeds: Option to enrich analysis with external threat intelligence.

6. Technical Considerations

    Binary Analysis Complexity: Incorporating robust binary analysis is challenging and resource-intensive.
        Disassembly/Decompilation: Requires sophisticated engines (e.g., leveraging open-source tools like Ghidra, Radare2, IDA Pro [commercial, consider licensing], or developing custom solutions). Accuracy and coverage across architectures are significant hurdles.
        Unpacking/Deobfuscation: This is an arms race. Malware authors constantly develop new techniques.
        Scalability: Deep binary analysis can be computationally expensive. Efficient scaling infrastructure is crucial.
        Expertise: Requires a team with deep knowledge of reverse engineering, compilers, operating system internals, and various CPU architectures.
    Sandboxing Infrastructure: Requires a secure, scalable, and diverse set of virtualized environments. Managing snapshots, avoiding detection, and ensuring isolation are key.
    AI/ML Models: Developing and training effective AI/ML models for threat scoring and classification requires large, well-curated datasets.
    Data Storage: Significant storage will be needed for samples, analysis artifacts, and reports.
    Security: The platform itself will be a target. Robust security measures are paramount.
